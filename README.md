> ## \* If some of the app's functionality doesn't work properly, consider using the .zip build. I haven't figured out the reason why applying/clearing mods folder is not working properly with Microsoft Store, but I suspect it might be tied to your windows version.
>
> ### Warning: If your mods folder is not symlinked to modpacks/<anything> your mods folder will be deleted after you apply/clear your modpack.
>
> #### Warning: Some features may not work properly on macOS, since I don't have a Mac and I can't test the app on it. If you have one and you know how to code, please submit a pr.
>
> Why can't I include modpacks from curseforge? Although I do have API access to curseforge modpack API, I cannot completely install everything from a modpack, since many modpacks tend to overwrite some of minecraft's settings and/or install external resource packs. I do not wish to deal with that.
