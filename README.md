# Minecraft Modpack Manager Reborn (Beta)
### WIP: This rewrite isn't 100% complete (yet)

## Working features:
* Applying modpacks
* Clearing modpacks
* Reloading modpacks in the list
* Opening modpacks folder
* Installing modpacks using .mcmodpackref

# Will be available on Flathub and Microsoft Store soon

## Warning: Some features may not work properly on macOS, since I don't have a Mac and I can't test the app on it. If you have one and you know how to code, please submit a pr.
