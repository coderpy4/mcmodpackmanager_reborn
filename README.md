> ## *ENABLE Developer mode on windows, or else the app won't work!
> ### Warning: If your mods folder is not symlinked to modpacks/<anything> your mods folder will be deleted after you apply/clear your modpack.
> #### Warning: Some features may not work properly on macOS, since I don't have a Mac and I can't test the app on it. If you have one and you know how to code, please submit a pr.
> Why can't I include modpacks from curseforge? Although I do have API access to curseforge modpack API, I cannot completely install everything from a modpack, since many modpacks tend to overwrite some of minecraft's settings and/or install external resource packs. I do not wish to deal with that.
